Welcome to my blog ðŸ™‚ I'm starting this as a place for me to dump my (somewhat organized thoughts) on whatever is on my mind. Truthfully, I expect 99% of the posts on this site to be programming related but I will leave the door open.

I don't know how often I'll blog here but if you're reading this hopefully you find some of my thoughts here interesting.
